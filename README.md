# Find-Your-Doctor

**Aim**

- The lack of health assistance by medical practioners into remote areas was our inspiration behind making the app. We are aiming to give access to every needy person to a doctor who can guide them and help in finding out diseases at earlier stages so that they can be cured faster and in a easier way.

**Main Functionalities**

- Find Your Doctor app helps a person to book their appointments with doctors through one click after signing into their account. After payment of fees, the appointment is confirmed. It gives the notification to the person what the doctor has to say. It also shows the medical reports. It has a discussion forum. Patients can also give feedback and view their status.


**Tools and Technologies used**

- We built it using html5.We used Adobe XD for designing the app.

**Extensions**

- We will put the feature that will make it easier to obtain a renewed prescription even on the expiration date which will save both time and money. Medical specialists can often detect the problem and make a diagnosis within a few seconds of visual contact .Skin problems, bruises, eye infections, and similar conditions can be diagnosed with the help of photos. We will put a feature using which a  patient can fill in a simple questionnaire, upload a photo, and wait for a diagnosis and treatment plan. If more information is needed, the doctor can respond with a request to provide it. All information and photos are placed on a separate server and only the doctor has access to them from the app.
